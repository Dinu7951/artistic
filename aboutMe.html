      Milestone Club, established during the 2022-2023 academic year, has
      rapidly grown to over 50 members, all driven by a shared goal: to
      empower students by giving them hands-on project experience. The club
      focuses on building resumes and sharpening practical skills through
      real-world projects. Each semester, members form teams, take on new
      challenges, and enhance their abilities as they progress. Our
      collaborative environment fosters growth, with weekly progress reviews
      and feedback sessions that encourage continuous improvement. We also
      prioritize listening to fresh ideas and supporting creative solutions.
      Milestone Club’s growth is fueled by its commitment to offering
      meaningful learning opportunities. In addition to project work, we aim
      to expand our reach by hosting more events, including workshops designed
      to further enrich our members’ skills. Every initiative we undertake is
      carefully designed to ensure maximum productivity and long-term value
      for participants. By focusing on real-world applications and fostering a
      supportive community, Milestone Club helps students build a strong
      foundation for their future careers.

      <h2>Devi Sri Venkat Kancherla</h2>
      <h4> Backend Developer and Team Leader</h4>
      <p>
        I had the privilege of leading the development
        of Artistic Alley, a platform designed for VIT AP students to showcase
        their talent. As a Team Leader, I guided my team in brainstorming
        features and ensuring smooth collaboration between frontend and
        backend. My focus as a Backend Developer involved building a secure
        and scalable system, managing the database, and developing the core
        functionality that powers the platform. I ensured seamless integration
        between the frontend and backend, enabling users to easily upload
        their artwork and interact with others. This project was an exciting
        blend of leadership, technical expertise, and problem-solving.
